<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
    Hello, my name is <b>Anna Rose Cimitile</b>. I am a native New Yorker who 
    resides in Brooklyn. I am attending NYC College of Technology, City Tech 
    to earn a second Bachelor's in Computer Systems. My first Bachelors is in 
    General Psychology from Baruch College. I have always loved technology and 
    wanted to go back to school for a technical degree and to work in the tech field. 
</p>
<p>
    Ultimately, I want to work in the Health & Wellness area of tech. I believe 
    that technology is meant to be for the people and I want to contribute my 
    knowledge, skills and attention to those who could utilize technology for 
    their health. I believe that technology will always be for the people first.
</p>
<p>
    My hobbies include working out, reading and playing Sudoku. I enjoy spending time 
    with my family and friends, and exploring restaurants with them too. I used to work 
    at a gym and after the TTPR cohort, I will be working on building websites.
